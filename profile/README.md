# Trott.AI

## Intro

The Trott.ai system aims to provide advanced monitoring and control features, including thermal imaging, temperature monitoring, noise level monitoring, camera surveillance, heat sensing, vibration sensing, and remote control of lights and fans. The system will utilize Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity and communicate with a smartphone app, enabling users to access real-time data, record location information, and review trip data. Additionally, the system will include a web-based admin portal for trailer management, customer support, historical data analysis, and configuration settings.

## Tech

The project involves Single Board Computer as a Gateway Unit, a MCU for handling sensors and actuators, a Smartphone app acting as an internet gateway, a web app with BackeEnd and FrontEnd hosted on a cloud server and a database also hosted on a cloud server.
